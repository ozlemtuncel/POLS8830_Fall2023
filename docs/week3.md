✔️ The goal of this week is to learn more about MLE.

## Here are some key points:
- We started reviewing last week's OLS assumptions and our homework. Normal-QQ plot is used for normality. Predicted vs fitted values plot shows linearity (line) and heteroskedasticty (dots).
- If we have bunch of ``control'' variables, I prefer to use beta prime and matrix $**X**$ instead of specifying every independent variables with betas.
- What does distributions do? It represents our observations and how they are distributed. It help us in model decisions.
