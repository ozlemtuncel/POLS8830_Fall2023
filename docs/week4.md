✔️ The goal of this week is to learn the binomial logit and probit and how to perform one in R. 
✅ We are also covering some details from last week's materials and talking about Problem Set II. 

## Here are some key points:
- R will give us log-odds as coefficients. This is impossible to interpret substantively.
- Instead, we recommend odds ratio and predicted probabilities.
- In interpreting your results, always start by stating the positive/negative relationship.
- Goodness of fit tests: Wald, PRE, AIC and BIC, likelihood ratio test! These should never be your ultimate guide in assessing your models. However, they are super helpful.
