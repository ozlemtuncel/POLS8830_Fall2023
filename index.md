> ✔️ Goal: Make sure you are familiar with basics of R.

> ⚠️ Our library offers online R workshops, and I highly recommend them! 

**Review of R**
I recommend Adam Kuczynski's (University of Washington) to review R: [Adam's Guide to R](https://adamkucz.github.io/psych548/)

**Learning LaTeX**
I encourage all of you to get familiar with **LaTeX** or similar kind of document preparation system to typset your problem sets. GSU offers online/in-person LaTeX course. I use Overleaf for typetting these sort of documents. Recently, I have been using Quarto in R and Phyton to typeset reports and presentations. Here are some useful links to learn LaTeX:

- GSU Library's [LaTeX workshop](https://research.library.gsu.edu/latex)
- Visit Dr. Fix's [website](http://michaelfix.gsucreate.org/) for his LaTeX presentations.
- Overleaf's [30-minute guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- Overleaf's detailed [3-part guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1))

You can alternatively learn and use **R Markdown** or **Quarto**. Here are some useful links:

- [Using Quarto in R](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- Posit's (previously known as R Studio) guide to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
