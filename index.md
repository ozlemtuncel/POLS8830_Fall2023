# Slides, Notes, and Tips

## Week 1
> ✔️ Goal: Review of the syllabus and last semester.

### Class materials 
[Week 1 Slides](docs/01Matrix.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 1 class](docs/week1.md)

### Software and others
> ✔️ Goal: Make sure you are familiar with basics of R.

> ⚠️ Our library offers online R workshops, and I highly recommend them! 

**Review of R**

I recommend Adam Kuczynski's (University of Washington) to review R ▶️ [Adam's Guide to R](https://adamkucz.github.io/psych548/)

**Learning LaTeX**

I encourage all of you to get familiar with **LaTeX** or similar kind of document preparation system to typset your problem sets. GSU offers online/in-person LaTeX course. I use Overleaf for typetting these sort of documents. Recently, I have been using Quarto in R and Phyton to typeset reports and presentations. Here are some useful links to learn LaTeX:

- GSU Library's [LaTeX workshop](https://research.library.gsu.edu/latex)
- Visit Dr. Fix's [website](http://michaelfix.gsucreate.org/) for his LaTeX presentations.
- Overleaf's [30-minute guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- Overleaf's detailed [3-part guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1))

You can alternatively learn and use **R Markdown** or **Quarto**. Here are some useful links:

- [Using Quarto in R](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- Posit's (previously known as R Studio) guide to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

## Week 2

### Class materials 
[Week 2 Slides](docs/Week 2 OLS Slides.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 2 class](docs/week2*.md) 

R scripts for Week 2: [Script I](docs/Week2_Linear_Regression_Addendum_tidy.R) & [Script II](docs/Week2_Linear_Regression_tidy.R) 

**More info on distributions and OLS**
- Here is a [website](https://www.rpubs.com/elliottb90/olsassumptions) that shows how to use plots to identify OLS assumptions.
- Here is a [comparison of probability mass and density functions](https://tinyheero.github.io/2016/03/17/prob-distr.html#properties-of-probability-massdensity-functions).

## Week 3

### Class materials 
[Week 3 Slides](docs/03MLE.pdf) and [Carlin's Notes](docs/Week 4 MLE & GLM.ppt)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 3 class](docs/week3.md) 

We do not have any R script for this week.

## Week 4

### Class materials 
[Week 4 Slides](docs/05Logit.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 4 class](docs/week4.md) 

R scripts for Week 4: [Script I](docs/Week4_Logit_Probit_Models_tidy.R) & [Script II](docs/Week4_PRE_tidy.R) 

### Important Note
❗You can find the change in the syllabus on iCollege. 

### Software and others 
- This is a great guide on [logit and probit](https://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/Logit.pdf) although the software is Stata.
- This is another great source to see how to perform logit and probit in [R, Stata, SAS, and SPSS](https://sites.google.com/site/econometricsacademy/econometrics-models/probit-and-logit-models).
- I recommend checking [Zelig](http://docs.zeligproject.org/) in detail if you are going to use logistic regression a lot.
- I also recommend this [Shiny app](https://xiangao.netlify.app/2017/10/26/rare-event/) for comparing logit, rare events, and Firth penalized MLE models.

## Week 5

### Class materials 
[Week 5 Slides](docs/Workflow_in_PoliSci_Research.pdf)

### Notes from Workflow lecture
- I know I bombarded you with a lot of information on GitHub, LaTeX, and R Studio. Do not be discouraged if you encounter any issues when using these programs. Make sure to read the error message, take a deep breath, and let Google help you.
- If you want to practice the GitHub exercise by yourself, check the links on my slides, or watch [this YouTube video that I based my own presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn-72tbRNFc&ab_channel=JohnLittle).
- Overleaf only allows GitHub and Dropbox version control for premium accounts. Yet, if you are using LaTeX software in your PC, you cannot connect your projects to GitHub like the R project I showed.
- See [resources part in my website](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/resources/) for CV, journal article, and Beamer templates in LaTeX. Check Academic and Software for templates. Hint: search ``latex CV template`` or ``beamer template`` in GitHub, you will find a lot of templates that you can fork, copy-paste, and use freely. If I need inspiration that's what I do most of the time.

### Software Notes
- I learned using GitHub with R using [this Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/).
